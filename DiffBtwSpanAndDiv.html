<h1>Difference between span and div</h1>
<div id="d1">
<p>
The div (division) element is a generic block-level element, most often used to divide page content into blocks. A block element is a page element that starts a new line and has a width equal to the entire page or the parent container.
<span id="s1">The span element is a generic inline element, typically used to apply styling to a portion of inline content.</span>

Youâ€™ll very often see divs used to group related paragraphs, images, headings, and links.
